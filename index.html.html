		<br><br><strong>This is my first website and I am glad to have you here.</strong>
		
		<strong>As you might already know, I am an 8th grade student at <abbr title="Dayanand Anglo Vedic Public school">D.A.V.P.S</abbr><em>(To know more about them <a href="http://www.dav14gurgaon.org/">click here)</a></em></strong>  

		<h1>My Interests</h1>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Programming or coding</li>
				<li>Data Analytics</li>
				<li>Web design</li>
				<li>Cricket, Football and many other sports</li>
			</ul>
 			
 			<p>If you want to see my experiences with the or am doing in the above mentioned aspects, keep scrolling</p>

 		<h2>Programming</h2>

 			<p><blockquote> &quot;Wether you want to uncover  the secrets of the universe, or just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.&quot;</p><p class="quote">-Stephen Hawking</blockquote></p>
 			
 			<h3>My Experience</h3>

 				<p>Programming can be very exhausting, irritating and agonising, I know that from first hand experience as earlier I use to hate it, the only reason, I tried to pursue it only bcuz I think it looks cool siting in fron of a laptop and typing code at a fast speed and now I like it and so will you, if you just give it a try.</p>

 			<h3>Software</h3>

 				<ol>
 					<li>HTML</li>
 						<p>It is one of the easiest as well as one of the most efficient languages.<mark>Fun fact:It is the language I am using right now , so, you know its good.</mark><br><br><em>P.S.: I prefer using an HTML editor, however a simple text editor like Notepad(PC) or TextEdit(Mac) will also work</em> <br><br><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/2">Download Sublime text 2[HTML Editor]</a></p>

 					<li>MIT App Inventor</li>
 						<p>Now if you are a super beginner and have <strong>absolutely</strong> no experience in programming, this one is for you. It's super simple, moderately efficient and by just watching a short 2 minute video, you&apos;ll get a good understanding of the the basics<br><br><a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">Go to MIT App Inventor</a></p>
 				</ol>	

 		<h2>Data Analytics</h2>

 			<h3>My Experience</h3>

 				<p>Now that is a heavy word but don&apos;t worry, it's just a fancy name for reading and understanding data that is taken from people like you or me. But if you want to see the dictionary definition, I have added it down below.Data analysis is sorta embedded inside programming ,so, once you have learnt about HTML or Java, you&apos;ll get a basic idea and if properly understood its not that difficult.</p>

 			<h3>Definition</h3>

 				<dl>
 					<dt>Data Analytics</dt>
 						<dd>A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making (<em>source wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis">Read the full page</a></em>)</dd>
 				</dl>

 			<h3>Software</h3>

 				<dl>
 					<dd>Python</dd>
 						<p>It is the most famous as well as the best data analysis programming software. Its is easy to learn and very powerful however, it is advisable to use an <abbr title="Integrated Development System">IDE</abbr> as Python itself looks very boring as well as it is not as user friendly
 						<br><br><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows">Download PyCharm community edition</a>
 						<br><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/">Download Python</a></p>

 					<dd>R</dd>
 						<p>It is a very efficient language that works almost like Python but it&rsquo;s a little unconventional than other languare so, it&rsquo;s better that you learn python first and also like python do remember to install <abbr title="Integrated Development System">IDE</abbr> an because it makes your life a lot easier
 						<br><br><a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">Download R Studio</a><br><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">Download R</a></p>
 				</dl>

 			<h2>Web Design</h2>

 				<h3>My Experience</h3>
 				<p>I love web design. I create User Interfraces and then code them(optional) for my clients. I have made various websites, One example is the site that you are seeing right now. See another one down below.
 				<br><br><img src="img/laptop edited.jpg" alt="Another website" width="347.5" height="540"></p>


 				<h3>Software</h3>
 				<ol>
 					<li>Adobe XD</li>
 						<p>This is the best UI/UX development software out there. It is the software that I use to make my code. It is super easy to learn, user friendly and dynamic. It is used for web as well as app development, so, you are not missing out on the good stuff.
